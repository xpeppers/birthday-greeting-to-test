# What's this?

This kata is inspired from [birthday-greetings-kata](https://github.com/xpmatteo/birthday-greetings-kata).

This is a complex code where you will be asked to add tests.

What do you can do when you have to deal with:

- Singleton
- Date (environment variables)
- Complex objects
- External services (e.g. SMTP or Files)

## How to start

Try to write tests for the class `BirthdayService`.
